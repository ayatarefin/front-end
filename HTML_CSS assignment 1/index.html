        <h2>About Arthur Morgan</h2>
        <p> Arthur Morgan is easily the most well-written character to come out of a <strong><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/">Rockstar game</a></strong>, and RDR2 benefits massively as a result. His mix of genuine humanity and ruthless talents builds a very meaningful and thoughtful man that players come to love over the course of his journey. Arthur Morgan is one of the best protagonists ever seen in a Rockstar title, and many players found him a relatable character. He holds numerous flaws, and he's a very sad and very tragic figure at his core. As a core member of the Van Der Linde Gang, and Dutch Van Der Linde's right hand man, Arthur has always been a capable enforcer. A man that personifies "cool, calmed, and collected", he knows how to get the job done and keep a smile on his face while doing so. He had a son named Isaac, with a waitress named Eliza, they sadly both died to a band of raiders who attacked their home while Arthur was away, he feels guilty about it. </p>

            <h2>About RDR2</h2> 
               <p>While the main theme of the original game was to protect family at all costs, Red Dead Redemption 2 tells the story of the breakdown of a family in the form of the Van der Linde gang. The team was interested in exploring the story of why the gang fell apart, as frequently mentioned in the first game.</p><br>
